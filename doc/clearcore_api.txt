Tentative thoughts on api with clearcore for motor control over serial comms

There's a few options here:
- Clearcore does all trajectory generation, kalman filtering, kinematics, and control
    - Central processor sends it marvelmind position data and forwards command from master
    - This requires a more extensive api to handle forwarding commands
- Clearcore recieves global velocity command from central processor, handles frame transformation and kinematics only
    - Sends back computed global velocity
    - Central processor has to send global angle along with command
    - Cnetral processor handles kalman filtering and trajectory generation
    - Relatively simple api
- Clearcore recieves local velocity command from central processors, handles local kinematics only
    - Sends back computed local velocity
    - Central processor handles kf, traj gen, frame conversion
    - Very simple api - seems like the best starting point


Starting with option 3

Send from central controller:
- Local velocity command [vx, vy, va]

Response from clearcore:
- Estimated local velocity [vx_est, vy_est, va_est]

Clearcore outline:
while true:
    if new command:
        decode command
        do IK
        send new motor commands
        do FK
        encode response
        send response (est vel)
    else:
        pass
