Robot SW:

Robot HW:
- Hook US sensors back up to robot for show (still needed?)

Master:
- Adjust getting too close issue
    - Try cranking up accel and decrease pause time for vision stop? Since the vision seems more robust now?

Robustify:
- Try re-printing marvelmind stands for more robustness
- Figure out why KF localization gets stuck in local minimum sometimes (maybe not needed?)
- Test master action validator
    - Fix action validator choking on START_CAMERA action
- Consider setting domino vision to 92.5 for y axis as many markers measure that
- Figure out why MM somtimes stops transmiting data to pi

Nice to haves:
- Detect when tray init needs to happen again after robot estop
- Fix hacky offset for domino field corner (I think the angle is just incorrect for that transform)
    - Maybe document (for my own sanity), all the various frames and reference points
- Add warnings to master screen when robot caps control effort
- Maybe consider rewrite of FieldPlanner (for fun) and to generally improve speed and ease of use.
- Fix motion unit tests commanding large velocities and tripping thresholding
- Fix localization tests
- Add more unit tests for camera and vision controller
