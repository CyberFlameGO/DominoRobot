- Diagnose delay in position update from robot
- Try to get plots generating from arduino serial plotter
    - Want to investigate jerkiness in controllers during fine motion
    - Want to investigate angle drift in controllers during fine motion
- Make controller robust so I only need to call fine pos once and get to the target
- Consider updating to raspi for better beacon interface, processing power, and wifi
- Investigate possibility of stepper motor control
- Investigate alternative DC motors
- Modify beacon locations/mounts to clear wires on robot
- Investigate cases where trajectory endpoint doesn't line up with target point somehow. Make sure robot can still reach target

Purchase:
- 2 more mini-rx beacons
- long and short usb A cables for arduino (to replace mine)
