Stepper controller:
- Wire up Nano for lifter control (including manual buttons)

Robot controller:

Robot SW::
- Figure out how to test position update function
- Fix failed traj gen not reporting up correctly and giving bogus values
- Fix failed traj gen not ending current command
- Fix blocked current command spamming command rejection message
- Debug why rotation motion didn't track correctly
    - Looks like clearcore wasn't tracking correctly? Some sort of error in the kinematics is my guess
    - Maybe not - looks like decoded velocity just lags by one iteration, maybe try to fix how that prints?
    - Might take some more digging/testing - robot thought it was at 1.57 (pi/2), but actual robot was at like 1/3 rotation (so just past 90) whereas robot on gui showed like half rotation (pi) 
- Add extra debug for trajectory parameters into motion log - time steps for transitions would be useful

Robot HW:
- Do clearcore calibration for one motor with full load
- Figure out how I want to hook up servo for lifter
- Hook the battery monitor up again
- Try to estimate how long the controller batteries will last fully loaded

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot
- Add a stop sequence and pause button
- Add a confirmation dialog before starting sequence
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)

Base station HW:
- Set up electronics
