- Fix angle wrapping in robot and mm code
- Try to get plots generating from arduino serial plotter
    - May need to diagnose the timing issues with serial printing (I think it may be related to the checkTrajectoryDone methods)
    - Want to investigate jerkiness in controllers during fine motion
    - Want to investigate angle drift in controllers during fine motion
- Goal is to only need to call fine pos once and get to the target
