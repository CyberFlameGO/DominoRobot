Robot:

Stepper controller
- Wire up Nano for lifter control (including manual buttons)
- Test stepper driver code (maybe use a test sketch rather than the full robot code to start)

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot

Base station:
- Set up electronics

Rpi Refactor:
- Keep adding tests
- Tests for controller
- Revisit marvelmind wrapper
- Prep for hardware testing

Purchase:
- 24V battery + wires for clearcore
- 5V regulator for raspi (and arduino nano?)

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message
