Robot:

Stepper controller
- Wire up Nano for lifter control (including manual buttons)
- Test stepper driver code (maybe use a test sketch rather than the full robot code to start)
- Update robot code to use new stepper interface

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot

Base station:
- Set up electronics


Expected rpi hardware connections
    - Serial to CC (probably usb)
    - Serial (?) to adruino tray controller (also usb?)
    - Marvelmind uses 2X usb

Rpi Refactor:
- Keep adding tests
- Get trajectory generator working with different approach angles
- Port Marvelmind to native usb, integrate into robot controller

Purchase:

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message
