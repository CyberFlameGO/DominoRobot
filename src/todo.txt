- Diagnose delay in position update from robot
- Try to get plots generating from arduino serial plotter
    - Want to investigate jerkiness in controllers during fine motion
    - Want to investigate angle drift in controllers during fine motion
- Make controller robust so I only need to call fine pos once and get to the target
- Consider updating to raspi for better beacon interface, processing power, and wifi
- Investigate cases where trajectory endpoint doesn't line up with target point somehow. Make sure robot can still reach target
- Test out new stepper code with full robot
- Hook up enable pins to motors
