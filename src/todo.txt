Robot:
- Controller tuning potential issues:
    - Delay while sending status update seems to cause impact to controller performance
    - Controller seems to be able to sometimes get into positive feedback situation
        - Seems to be an issue with one of the motors, need to plot some more to figure out whats going on
    - Motors have stiction that is on the order of magnitude of how fast I want to move
    - Back wheels can slip sometimes, adding more weight doesn't seem to fix it
        - All 4 wheels still not making good contact sometimes
        - More weight on back seems to fix (jk not always)

Stepper controller
- Convert to working for lifter mechanism

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot

Base station:

Purchase:

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message
