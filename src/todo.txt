Robot SW:
- Fix localization issue where it gets too confident and doesn't accept any more updates (might be fixed with recent retuning?)
- Fix rotation issue - maybe localization isn't correctly being updated during vision mode?
- Collect interesting images and make into unit test

Robot HW:

Master:
- Test master action validator
    - Fix action validator choking on START_CAMERA action
- Consider setting MM fine pose a bit further away from the dominos than the actual target point (to avoid overshoot)

Robustify:
- Detect when tray init needs to happen again after robot estop
- Figure out why the robot sometimes overshoots and quickly corrects motion (low battery??)
- Add warnings to master screen when robot caps control effort
- Consider adjusting vision mode to take over motion as soon as mavelmind mode is close-ish and both markers are detected.

Nice to haves:
- Maybe consider rewrite of FieldPlanner (for fun) and to generally improve speed and ease of use.
- Fix motion unit tests commanding large velocities and tripping thresholding
- Fix localization tests
- Add more unit tests for camera and vision controller
