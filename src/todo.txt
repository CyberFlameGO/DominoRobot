Robot:
- Test analog voltage sending to controller
- Test lifter stepper control
- Test lifter servo control
- Test lifter homing/switch control

Stepper controller

Master:
- Add actions for base station
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot
- Finish up status panels for gui
- Make gui look a little bit better
- Figure out if there is a way to use the output pane better - maybe also log to file or dump to console?

Base station:
- Put together skeleton code for base station

Purchase:
- Possibly a usb A -> usb MINI cable for the arduino nanos




Embedded (old, maybe not needed anymore):
- Diagnose delay in position update from robot
- Controller tuning:
    - Try to get plots generating from arduino serial plotter
    - Want to investigate jerkiness in controllers during fine motion
    - Want to investigate angle drift in controllers during fine motion
- Interface with lifter steppers
    - Investigate arduino timers to handle steps naitviely
    - May need to try turning off comms for this (?)
    - May be able to test out with simple sketch on uno I have at home
