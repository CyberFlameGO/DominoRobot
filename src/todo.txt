Embedded (maybe not needed anymore):
- Diagnose delay in position update from robot
- Controller tuning:
    - Try to get plots generating from arduino serial plotter
    - Want to investigate jerkiness in controllers during fine motion
    - Want to investigate angle drift in controllers during fine motion

Embedded (definitely needed):
- Separate stepper control from control loop
- Handle high level behaviors
- Handle pausing behaviors
- Interface with lifter steppers
    - Investigate arduino timers to handle steps naitviely
    - May need to try turning off comms for this (?)
    - May be able to test out with simple sketch on uno I have at home
- Interface with latch servo
- Interface with lifter bump switch

Master:
- Actually use plan in runtime
- Add high level behavior steps (including pause)
- Improve robustness, cleanlieness, and interface
- Interface with base station

Base station:
- Put together skeleton code for base station

Purchase:
- Bump switches
