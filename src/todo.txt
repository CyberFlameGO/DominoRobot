Robot:
- Controller tuning potential issues:
    - Delay while sending status update seems to cause impact to controller performance
    - Controller seems to be able to sometimes get into positive feedback situation
        - Seems to be an issue with one of the motors, need to plot some more to figure out whats going on
        - Made some plots, still not totally clear what is going on. Basically looks like motor2 gets into a situation
            where the controller is indeed doing the right thing, but the motor is respoding by moving in the opposite direction
            as intended. Probably need to do some more testing on this specific motor to understand what is going on or if something
            is wired incorrectly or something.
        - Consider adding motor level velocity limits and over-speed detection
    - Motors have stiction that is on the order of magnitude of how fast I want to move
        - Need to investigate how to mitigate stiction in controller
    - Back wheels can slip sometimes, adding more weight doesn't seem to fix it
        - All 4 wheels still not making good contact sometimes
        - More weight on back seems to fix (jk not always)

Stepper controller
- Wire up Nano for lifter control (including manual buttons)
- Test stepper driver code (maybe use a test sketch rather than the full robot code to start)
- Update robot code to use new stepper interface

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot

Base station:


Expected rpi hardware connections
    - Serial to CC (probably usb)
    - Serial (?) to adruino tray controller (also usb?)
    - Marvelmind uses 2X usb

Rpi Refactor:
- Keep adding tests
- Get comms working with CC (need to figure out USB serial comm)
    -https://www.monocilindro.com/2017/02/19/how-to-connect-arduino-and-raspberry-pi-using-usb-and-c/
    -https://github.com/manashmandal/SerialPort
    -https://github.com/wjwwood/serial
- Get trajectory generator working with different approach angles
- Add back in status updater
- Port Marvelmind to native usb, integrate into robot controller
- Port lifter controller to use external arduino

Purchase:

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message
