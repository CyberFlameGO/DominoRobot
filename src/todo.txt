Stepper controller:
- Wire up Nano for lifter control (including manual buttons)

Robot controller:

Robot SW::
- Figure out how to test position update function
- Configure raspi for dominonet network

Robot HW:
- Do clearcore calibration for one motor with full load
- Get a power switch for control electronics (maybe one for clearcore and one for raspi?)
- Ping josh about getting covers for the belts
- Figure out how I want to hook up servo for lifter
- Hook the battery monitor up again
- Try to estimate how long the controller batteries will last fully loaded

Ask josh:
- Confirm gear ratio
- Get cover for belts
- One belt is tight but others aren't
- Ask josh about better shaft attaching system

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot
- Add a stop sequence and pause button
- Add a confirmation dialog before starting sequence

Base station HW:
- Set up electronics

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message (and simply fail more gracefully)
