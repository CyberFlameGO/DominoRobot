Robot SW:
- Test updated trajectory generation, see if it resolves angle issue with mm. 

Robot HW:

Master:
- Test docking actions
    - Figure out if any adjustments are needed to fine motion, vision motion when docking
- Test increasing status request rate, may allow to decrease action wait time and shave a few seconds off of actions like start/stop cameras
- Fix hacky offset for domino field corner (I think the angle is just incorrect for that transform)
    - Maybe document (for my own sanity), all the various frames and reference points

Robustify:
- Consider setting MM fine pose a bit further away from the dominos than the actual target point (to avoid overshoot)
- Test master action validator
    - Fix action validator choking on START_CAMERA action
- Consider adjusting vision mode to take over motion as soon as mavelmind mode is close-ish and both markers are detected.

Nice to haves:
- Detect when tray init needs to happen again after robot estop
- Add warnings to master screen when robot caps control effort
- Maybe consider rewrite of FieldPlanner (for fun) and to generally improve speed and ease of use.
- Fix motion unit tests commanding large velocities and tripping thresholding
- Fix localization tests
- Add more unit tests for camera and vision controller
