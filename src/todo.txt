Robot controller:

Robot SW::
- Figure out how to test position update function
- Figure out why clock goes bad during test
- Debug why rotation motion didn't track correctly
    - Looks like clearcore wasn't tracking correctly? Some sort of error in the kinematics is my guess
    - Maybe not - looks like decoded velocity just lags by one iteration, maybe try to fix how that prints?
    - Might take some more digging/testing - robot thought it was at 1.57 (pi/2), but actual robot was at like 1/3 rotation (so just past 90) whereas robot on gui showed like half rotation (pi) 

Robot HW:
- Try to estimate how long the controller batteries will last fully loaded
    - Powering pi, clearcore, servo, and optoswitch
- Try to estimate how long robot batteries will last (draw seems to be ~0.3-1 A)
- Figure out and document safe low battery level before recharge is needed

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot
- Add error handling for robot status
- Add a stop sequence and pause button
- Add a confirmation dialog before starting sequence
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add unit tests
- Make generating plan workflow more streamlined (maybe initiate from master gui?)
- Document use of master gui for testing (installation, setup robot, running etc.)
- Make robot1 default selected target field

Base station HW:
- Set up electronics
