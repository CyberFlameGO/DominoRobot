Stepper controller:

Robot controller:

Robot SW::
- Figure out how to test position update function
- Debug why rotation motion didn't track correctly
    - Looks like clearcore wasn't tracking correctly? Some sort of error in the kinematics is my guess
    - Maybe not - looks like decoded velocity just lags by one iteration, maybe try to fix how that prints?
    - Might take some more digging/testing - robot thought it was at 1.57 (pi/2), but actual robot was at like 1/3 rotation (so just past 90) whereas robot on gui showed like half rotation (pi) 

Robot HW:
- Try to estimate how long the controller batteries will last fully loaded
    - Powering pi, clearcore, servo, and optoswitch
- Try to estimate how long robot batteries will last (draw seems to be ~0.3-1 A)
- Figure out and document safe low battery level before recharge is needed

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot
- Add unit tests (?)

Base station HW:
- Set up electronics
