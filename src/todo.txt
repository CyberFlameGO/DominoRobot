Robot:
- Test and tune top level controller for new motors 
- Try to hunt down that blasted 2x error, or at least adjust so I'm not scaling the input speed
    - I confirmed that just pushing the robot around definitely has an error (so odom only). That is about 2x.

Stepper controller
- Convert to working for lifter mechanism

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot

Base station:

Purchase:

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message




Embedded (old, maybe not needed anymore):
- Diagnose delay in position update from robot
- Controller tuning:
    - Try to get plots generating from arduino serial plotter
    - Want to investigate jerkiness in controllers during fine motion
    - Want to investigate angle drift in controllers during fine motion
