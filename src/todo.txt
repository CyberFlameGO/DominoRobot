Stepper controller:
- Wire up Nano for lifter control (including manual buttons)

Robot controller:

Robot SW::
- Figure out how to test position update function
- Put together simple script for testing motors (simple straight back and forth)
    - Probalby just a small python script that sends commands over serial to clearcore

Robot HW:
- Get electronics on the robot and fully wired
- Do clearcore calibration for one motor with full load

Master:
- Figure out how to sequence loading between base and robot
- Add a stop sequence and pause button
- Add a confirmation dialog before starting sequence

Base station HW:
- Set up electronics

QOL stuff:
- Try to make it so master doesn't crash when network has trouble (need to handle detecting disconnect and then auto-reconnecting)
- Add check to master to verify network is correct and print a useful message (and simply fail more gracefully)
